Getting and Cleaning Data - Course Project
==========================================

This repository hosts the R code and documentation files for the "Getting and Cleaning data" course project.

The dataset being used is: [Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones)

## Files

The code takes for granted all the data is present in the same folder, un-compressed and without names altered.
CodeBook.md describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that was performed to clean up the data.
run_analysis.R contains all the code to perform the analyses described in the 5 steps.
The output of the 5th step is called tidy_data.txt and uploaded in the course project's form.
