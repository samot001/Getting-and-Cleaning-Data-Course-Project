Getting and Cleaning Data - Course Project
==========================================

This repository hosts the R code and documentation files for the "Getting and Cleaning data" course project.

## Files

The code takes for granted all the data is present in the same folder.
CodeBook.md describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that was performed to clean up the data.
run_analysis.R contains all the code to perform the analyses described in the 5 steps.
The output of the 5th step is called tidy_data.txt and uploaded in the course project's form.
